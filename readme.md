# Communicating Data Findings - Marketing Analytics
## by Amani Ezzat


## Marketing Analytics Dataset

> This data set was provided to students for their final project as part of a MSc in Business Analytics. I got it from www.Kaggle.com
> The dataset marketing_data.csv consists of 2,240 customers of XYZ company. Please be informed that the columns meanings will be attached for your consideration.

> I did some data wrangling steps in order to prepare the dataset for visualization, I made sure that the dataset has no duplicates, did fill the missing values, and change the data type that was not appropriate.


## Summary of Findings

> The last Campiagn was not successful.

> The average number of days since the last purchase a customer makes is 50 days which is a huge number. So, the store needs to come up with a plan to encourage the customers to go back to the store and be loyal ones.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> 40% out of the customers are married and almost 21% are single.

> The store needs a strategic marketing plan.
